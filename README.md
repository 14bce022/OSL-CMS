CMS ( Content Management System ) :
CMS became a buzz word in the web development industry because of its benefits. CMS
stands for Content Management System. It is a term and has not been endorsed with a solid
definition. A CMS can have multiple meanings depending on the scenarios and the person's or
project objectives. To add to the confusion, an organization named AIIM (Association for
Information and Image Management) claimed the acronym ECM (Enterprise Content
Management) and WCM (Web Content Management) as their creation and came up with their
own definition that suites their organization's services.
AIIM changed their definition of ECM a few times and submitted their definitions to Wikipedia,
which is now published. At the time of this writing, for most scenarios, when someone in the
web development industry is talking about CMS (Content Management System), or ECMS
(Enterprise Content Management System), he / she is more likely referring to either the first or
second definition below.
